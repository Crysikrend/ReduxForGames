# ReduxForGames

A remake of my [assignment, Alacrity](http://github.com/Ashe/alacrity) made in my own engine.

## What is this?
A test of my ability. I am simply reusing code from another project to test my SDL+OpenGL engine I have spent the last few nights agonising over. Problems will be fixed depending on whether or not I choose to submit this or my DirectX version. I would heavily consider the build in its current state ***broken*** because of level 4. Also, the UI has not been ported across yet.

## Dependencies
- SDL2
- GLM
- GLEW
- SOIL

## Wanna Play?
Just unzip the `debug` folder and hit that `.exe`!

## Bugs? Yes.
This game is a port from an assignment I worked on with DirectX. I am simply reusing the code to test if it works - turns out it does, but it has a long way to go. Anyway, there are a lot of things that aren't jamming - you will find the 4th level problematic in movement and I have also experienced a crash in the game upon travelling to the back-right edge of the level.
